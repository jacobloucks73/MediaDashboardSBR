For example, a REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record.
A POST request creates a new record. A PUT request updates a record, and a DELETE request deletes one.
All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running
in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
